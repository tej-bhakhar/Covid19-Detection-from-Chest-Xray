## üìå Project Overview  
The **COVID-19 Detection using Chest X-rays** project leverages **Deep Learning (CNN with ResNet-50)** to identify COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images.  

This project provides:  
- **Early detection** for rapid screening.  
- **Automated predictions** using trained CNN models.  
- A **Flask web application** to upload X-ray images and get results instantly.
